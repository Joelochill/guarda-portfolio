    <p>Joel Rico Rada is a Basque sound artist based in Zaragoza.</p>
    <p>
      Joel is GUARDA, a stage for the strange, the secret, and the silent. A
      dark project with a clear personal imprint. Through his music, GUARDA aims
      to generate unease and awaken a sense of uncertainty. He works with noise,
      combining field recordings, modular synthesis, and spoken word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graduated in Fine Arts from the University of Zaragoza, he specialized in
      video and documentary audio. He conceives the horror genre as a necessary
      medium for the exposure and understanding of internal evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Piedra de La Locura is GUARDA's debut album. A dark journey through the
      loss of faith, the confrontation with anxiety, and the search for identity
      and meaning. It addresses universal themes such as the need for balance or
      the desire for transcendence. Guarda holds secrets; it is an introspective
      and emotional work, a deep meditation on madness and death.
    </p>
    <p>Joel is half of the bands Mejor Sordo and ACITDX.</p>
